I decided to study Software Engineering because I want to be progressive in the world of Technologies.  I know technology is always evolving and I wanna be able to move along that wave of endless opportunities. I know by lerning some of these basic programming languages I will have an easier time later on learning more and more , and being able to broaden my skills in programming. I want to study Software Engineering, so I can always have an opportunity to learn new things and learn to adapt to changes and grow from it. I aso want to go into this field, so I can have a source to channel and use my creativity with my code. I have always been a creative problem solver,  so I think this is going to be a good fit for me.
